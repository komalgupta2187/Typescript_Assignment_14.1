 Create a service with get method using any data.json file and ‚óè Create a method in your component to call that service and render   that data to your view

I have used angular-cli for this project and so it will run with command: ng serve on localhost:4200

Service is in product.service

data.json contains data to be rendered

component is in app.component

view rendered in app.component.html
